Revision history for Perl extension Astro::SolarParallax.

0.01  Fri Apr 16 21:13:29 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX -n Astro::SolarParallax

0.02 2004-05-26
	- Seems like CPAN refuses my developer releases, as a first
	release, even when it is contained in a non-developer
	release. So, I just changed some version numbers. 

0.03  
	- I don't think it really requires any new version of Perl, so
	I removed the requirement from MakeFile.PL.

0.04  2004-08-21 01:21
	- Added SIGNATURE and some related small changes
